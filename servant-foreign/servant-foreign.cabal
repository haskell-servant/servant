synopsis:            Helpers for generating clients for servant APIs in any programming language
description:
  Helper types and functions for generating client functions for servant APIs in any programming language
  .
  This package provides types and functions that collect all the data needed to generate client functions in the programming language of your choice. This effectively means you only have to write the code that "pretty-prints" this data as some code in your target language.
  .
  See the servant-js package for an example
