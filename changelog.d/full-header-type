synopsis: Use `Header'` in response headers.
prs: #1697

description: {

Use `Header'` instead of `Header` in response, so it's possible to provide
`Description`, for example:

```
type PaginationTotalCountHeader =
  Header'
    '[ Description "Indicates to the client total count of items in collection"
     , Optional
     , Strict
     ]
    "Total-Count"
    Int
```

Note: if you want to add header with description you should use `addHeader'`
or `noHeader'` which accepts `Header'` with all modifiers.

}
