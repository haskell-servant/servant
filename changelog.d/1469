synopsis: Derive HasClient good response status from Verb status
prs: #1469
description: {
`HasClient` instances for the `Verb` datatype use `runRequest` in
`clientWithRoute` definitions.
This means that a request performed with `runClientM` will be successful if and
only if the endpoint specify a response status code >=200 and <300.
This change replaces `runRequest` with `runRequestAcceptStatus` in `Verb`
instances for the `HasClient` class, deriving the good response status from
the `Verb` status.
}
