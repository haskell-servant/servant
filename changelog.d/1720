synopsis: Client Middleware
prs: #1720

description: {

Clients now support real middleware of type `(Request -> ClientM Response) -> Request -> ClientM Response` which can be configured in `ClientEnv`.
This allows access to raw request and response data. It can also be used to control how/when/if actual requests are performed.
