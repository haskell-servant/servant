synopsis: Remove -XStrictData from servant{,-server}'s cabal files
packages: servant servant-server
prs: #1781
issues: #1780
significance: significant
description: {
  The addition of -XStrictData to servant.cabal and servant-server.cabal reduced the laziness
  of routing, which would trigger unimplemented endpoints using `error` or `undefined`,
  despite the fact that these endpoints themselves were not queried.
}
