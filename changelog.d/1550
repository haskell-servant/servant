synopsis: Refactor NoContentVerb into NoContentVerbWithStatus
prs: #1550
issues: #1532

description: {

There are several HTTP status codes that correspond to a response body with `NoContent`. This PR introduces `NoContentVerbWithStatus` which generalizes `NoContentVerb` to cases when the return status may be
different from `204`. The former replaces the latter anywhere possible.
`NoContentVerb` is kept as a special case of `NoContentVerbWithStatus` for backwards compatibility.

This PR also adds a test case for `NoContentVerbWithStatus` in `ServerSpec.hs`
