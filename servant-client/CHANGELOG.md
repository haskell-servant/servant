### Significant changes

- Add NoContentVerb [#1028](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/issues/1028) [#1219](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/1219) [#1228](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/1228)

  The `NoContent` API endpoints should now use `NoContentVerb` combinator.
  The API type changes are usually of the kind

  ```diff
  - :<|> PostNoContent '[JSON] NoContent
  + :<|> PostNoContent
  ```

  i.e. one doesn't need to specify the content-type anymore. There is no content.

- `Capture` can be `Lenient` [#1155](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/issues/1155) [#1156](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/1156)

  You can specify a lenient capture as

  ```haskell
  :<|> "capture-lenient"  :> Capture' '[Lenient] "foo" Int :> GET
  ```

  which will make the capture always succeed. Handlers will be of the
  type `Either String CapturedType`, where `Left err` represents
  the possible parse failure.

- *servant-client* Added a function to create Client.Request in ClientEnv [#1213](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/1213) [#1255](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/1255)

  The new member `makeClientRequest` of `ClientEnv` is used to create
  `http-client` `Request` from `servant-client-core` `Request`.
  This functionality can be used for example to set
  dynamic timeouts for each request.

### Other changes

- *servant-client* *servant-client-core* *servant-http-streams* Fix Verb with headers checking content type differently [#1200](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/issues/1200) [#1204](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/1204)

  For `Verb`s with response `Headers`, the implementation didn't check
  for the content-type of the response. Now it does.

- *servant-client* *servant-http-streams* `HasClient` instance for `Stream` with `Headers` [#1170](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/issues/1170) [#1197](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/1197)
- *servant-client* Redact the authorization header in Show and exceptions [#1238](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/1238)



0.16.0.1
--------

- Allow `base-compat-0.11`

0.16
----

- Rename `ServantError` to `ClientError`, `ServantErr` to `ServerError`
  [#1131](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/1131)

- *servant-client-core* Rearrange modules. No more `Internal` modules, whole
  API is versioned.
  [#1130](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/1130)

- *servant-client-core* `RequestBody` is now

    ```haskell
    = RequestBodyLBS LBS.ByteString
    | RequestBodyBS BS.ByteString
    | RequestBodySource (SourceIO LBS.ByteString)
    ```

  i.e. no more replicates `http-client`s API.
  [#1117](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/1117)

- *servant-client-core* Keep structured exceptions in `ConnectionError`
  constructor of `ClientError`
  [#1115](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/1115)

    ```diff
    -| ConnectionError Text
    +| ConnectionError SomeException
    ```

- *servant-client-core* Preserve failing request in `FailureResponse`
  constructor of `ClientError`
  [#1114](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/1114)

    ```diff
    -FailureResponse Response
    +-- | The server returned an error response including the
    +-- failing request. 'requestPath' includes the 'BaseUrl' and the
    +-- path of the request.
    +FailureResponse (RequestF () (BaseUrl, BS.ByteString)) Response
    ```

- *servant-client* Fix (implement) `StreamBody` instance
  [#1110](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/1110)

- *servant-client* Update CookieJar with intermediate request/responses (redirects)
  [#1104](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/1104)

- Streaming refactoring.
  [#991](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/991)
  [#1076](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/1076)
  [#1077](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/1077)

  The streaming functionality (`Servant.API.Stream`) is refactored to use
  `servant`'s own `SourceIO` type (see `Servant.Types.SourceT` documentation),
  which replaces both `StreamGenerator` and `ResultStream` types.

  New conversion type-classes are `ToSourceIO` and `FromSourceIO`
  (replacing `ToStreamGenerator` and `BuildFromStream`).
  There are instances for *conduit*, *pipes* and *machines* in new packages:
  [servant-conduit](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/servant-conduit)
  [servant-pipes](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/servant-pipes) and
  [servant-machines](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/servant-machines)
  respectively.

  Writing new framing strategies is simpler. Check existing strategies for examples.

  This change shouldn't affect you, if you don't use streaming endpoints.

- *servant-client* Separate streaming client.
  [#1066](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/1066)

  We now have two `http-client` based clients,
  in `Servant.Client` and `Servant.Client.Streaming`.

  Their API is the same, except for
  - `Servant.Client` **cannot** request `Stream` endpoints.
  - `Servant.Client` is *run* by direct
    `runClientM :: ClientM a -> ClientEnv -> IO (Either ServantError a)`
  - `Servant.Client.Streaming` **can** request `Stream` endpoints.
  - `Servant.Client.Streaming` is *used* by CPSised
    `withClientM :: ClientM a -> ClientEnv -> (Either ServantError a -> IO b) -> IO b`

  To access `Stream` endpoints use `Servant.Client.Streaming` with
  `withClientM`; otherwise you can continue using `Servant.Client` with `runClientM`.
  You can use both too, `ClientEnv` and `BaseUrl` types are same for both.

  **Note:** `Servant.Client.Streaming` doesn't *stream* non-`Stream` endpoints.
  Requesting ordinary `Verb` endpoints (e.g. `Get`) will block until
  the whole response is received.

  There is `Servant.Client.Streaming.runClientM` function, but it has
  restricted type. `NFData a` constraint prevents using it with
  `SourceT`, `Conduit` etc. response types.

  ```haskell
  runClientM :: NFData a => ClientM a -> ClientEnv -> IO (Either ServantError a)
  ```

  This change shouldn't affect you, if you don't use streaming endpoints.

- Drop support for GHC older than 8.0
  [#1008](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/1008)
  [#1009](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/1009)

- *servant-client-core* Add `NFData (GenResponse a)` and `NFData ServantError` instances.
  [#1076](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/1076)

 *servant-client-core* Add `aeson` and `Lift BaseUrl` instances
  [#1037](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/1037)

- `Stream` takes a status code argument

  ```diff
  -Stream method        framing ctype a
  +Stream method status framing ctype a
  ```

  ([#966](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/966)
   [#972](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/972))

- `ToStreamGenerator` definition changed, so it's possible to write an instance
  for conduits.

  ```diff
  -class ToStreamGenerator f a where
  -   toStreamGenerator :: f a -> StreamGenerator a
  +class ToStreamGenerator a b | a -> b where
  +   toStreamGenerator :: a -> StreamGenerator b
  ```

  ([#959](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/959))

- Added `NoFraming` streaming strategy
  ([#959](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/959))

- *servant-client-core* Add `hoistClient` to `HasClient`.
  Just like `hoistServer` allows us to change the monad in which request handlers
  of a web application live, we also have `hoistClient` for changing the monad
  in which *client functions* live.
  Read [tutorial section for more information](https://docs.servant.dev/en/release-0.14/tutorial/Client.html#changing-the-monad-the-client-functions-live-in).
  ([#936](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/936))

- *servant-client* Add more constructors to `RequestBody`, including
  `RequestBodyStream`.
  *Note:* we are looking for http-library agnostic API,
  so the might change again soon.
  Tell us which constructors are useful for you!
  ([#913](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/913))
