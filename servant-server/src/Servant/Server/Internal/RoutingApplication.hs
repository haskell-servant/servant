-- We currently mix up the order in which we perform checks
-- and the priority with which errors are reported.
--
-- For example, we perform Capture checks prior to method checks,
-- and therefore get 404 before 405.
--
-- However, we also perform body checks prior to method checks
-- now, and therefore get 415 before 405, which is wrong.
--
-- If we delay Captures, but perform method checks eagerly, we
-- end up potentially preferring 405 over 404, whcih is also bad.
--
-- So in principle, we'd like:
--
-- static routes (can cause 404)
-- delayed captures (can cause 404)
-- methods (can cause 405)
-- delayed body (can cause 415, 400)
-- accept header (can cause 406)
--
-- According to the HTTP decision diagram, the priority order
-- between HTTP status codes is as follows:
--

-- | A 'Delayed' is a representation of a handler with scheduled
-- delayed checks that can trigger errors.
--
-- Why would we want to delay checks?
--
-- There are two reasons:
--
-- 1. Currently, the order in which we perform checks coincides
-- with the error we will generate. This is because during checks,
-- once an error occurs, we do not perform any subsequent checks,
-- but rather return this error.
--
-- This is not a necessity: we could continue doing other checks,
-- and choose the preferred error. However, that would in general
-- mean more checking, which leads us to the other reason.
--
-- 2. We really want to avoid doing certain checks too early. For
-- example, captures involve parsing, and are much more costly
-- than static route matches. In particular, if several paths
-- contain the "same" capture, we'd like as much as possible to
-- avoid trying the same parse many times. Also tricky is the
-- request body. Again, this involves parsing, but also, WAI makes
-- obtaining the request body a side-effecting operation. We
-- could/can work around this by manually caching the request body,
-- but we'd rather keep the number of times we actually try to
-- decode the request body to an absolute minimum.
--
-- We prefer to have the following relative priorities of error
-- codes:
--
-- @
-- 404
-- 405 (bad method)
-- 401 (unauthorized)
-- 415 (unsupported media type)
-- 400 (bad request)
-- 406 (not acceptable)
-- @
--
-- Therefore, while routing, we delay most checks so that they
-- will ultimately occur in the right order.
--
-- A 'Delayed' contains three delayed blocks of tests, and
-- the actual handler:
--
-- 1. Delayed captures. These can actually cause 404, and
-- while they're costly, they should be done first among the
-- delayed checks (at least as long as we do not decouple the
-- check order from the error reporting, see above). Delayed
-- captures can provide inputs to the actual handler.
--
-- 2. Method check(s). This can cause a 405. On success,
-- it does not provide an input for the handler. Method checks
-- are comparatively cheap.
--
-- 3. Body and accept header checks. The request body check can
-- cause both 400 and 415. This provides an input to the handler.
-- The accept header check can be performed as the final
-- computation in this block. It can cause a 406.
