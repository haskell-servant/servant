# servant - A Type-Level Web DSL

![servant](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haskell-servant/servant/master/servant.png)

## Getting Started

We have a [tutorial](http://haskell-servant.readthedocs.org/en/stable/tutorial/index.html) that
introduces the core features of servant. After this article, you should be able
to write your first servant webservices, learning the rest from the haddocks'
examples.

The central documentation can be found [here](http://haskell-servant.readthedocs.org/).
Other blog posts, videos and slides can be found on the
[website](http://haskell-servant.github.io/).

If you need help, drop by the IRC channel (#servant on freenode) or [mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/haskell-servant).
