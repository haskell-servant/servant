servant – A Type-Level Web DSL
==============================

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haskell-servant/servant/master/servant.png

**servant** is a set of packages for declaring web APIs at the type-level and
then using those API specifications to:

- write servers (this part of **servant** can be considered a web framework),
- obtain client functions (in haskell),
- generate client functions for other programming languages and
- generate documentation for your web applications.

All in a type-safe manner.
