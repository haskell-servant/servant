Cookbook
========

This page is a *collective effort* whose goal is to show
how to solve many common problems with servant. If you're
interested in contributing examples of your own, feel free
to open an issue or a pull request on
`our github repository <https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant>`_
or even to just get in touch with us on the `**#haskell-servant** IRC channel
on libera.chat <https://web.libera.chat/#haskell-servant>_ or on
`the mailing list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/haskell-servant>`_.

The scope is very wide. Simple and fancy authentication schemes,
file upload, type-safe links, working with CSV, .zip archives,
you name it!
