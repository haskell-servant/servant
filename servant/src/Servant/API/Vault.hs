-- | Use 'Vault' in your API types to provide access to the 'Vault'
--   of the request, which is a location shared by middlewares and applications
--   to store arbitrary data. See <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vault vault>
--   for more details on how to actually use the vault in your handlers
--
-- Example:
--
-- >>> type API = Vault :> Get '[JSON] String

-- $setup
-- >>> import Servant.API
