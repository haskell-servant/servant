### Breaking changes

* Use `NT` from `natural-transformation` for `Enter`
  ([#616](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/issues/616))

* Change to `MkLink (Verb ...) = Link` (previously `URI`). To consume `Link`
  use its `ToHttpApiData` instance or `linkURI`.
  ([#527](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/issues/527))

### Other changes

* Add `Servant.API.TypeLevel` module with type families to work with API types.
  ([#345](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/345)
  , [#305](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/issues/305))

* Default JSON content type change to `application/json;charset=utf-8`.
  ([#263](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/issues/263))

  ([#613](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/614)
  , [#615](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/615))

functionaliy.

* Add `WithNamedConfig` combinator.
* Add `HttpVersion`, `IsSecure`, `RemoteHost` and `Vault` combinators
* Fix safeLink, so Header is not in fact required.
* Add more instances for (:<|>)
* Use `http-api-data` instead of `Servant.Common.Text`
* Remove matrix params.
* Add PlainText String MimeRender and MimeUnrender instances.
* Add new `Verbs` combinator, and make all existing and new verb combinators
type synonyms of it.

* Multiple content-type/accept support for all the relevant combinators
* Provide *JSON*, *PlainText*, *OctetStream* and *FormUrlEncoded* content types out of the box
* Type-safe link generation to API endpoints
* Support for the PATCH HTTP method
* Removed the home-made QuasiQuote for writing API types in a more human-friendly format until we come up with a better design for it
* Make most if not all of the haddock code examples run through doctest
* Some general code cleanup
