### Significant changes

- Add NoContentVerb [#1028](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/issues/1028) [#1219](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/1219) [#1228](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/1228)

  The `NoContent` API endpoints should now use `NoContentVerb` combinator.
  The API type changes are usually of the kind

  ```diff
  - :<|> PostNoContent '[JSON] NoContent
  + :<|> PostNoContent
  ```

  i.e. one doesn't need to specify the content-type anymore. There is no content.

- `Capture` can be `Lenient` [#1155](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/issues/1155) [#1156](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/1156)

  You can specify a lenient capture as

  ```haskell
  :<|> "capture-lenient"  :> Capture' '[Lenient] "foo" Int :> GET
  ```

  which will make the capture always succeed. Handlers will be of the
  type `Either String CapturedType`, where `Left err` represents
  the possible parse failure.

- *servant-client* Added a function to create Client.Request in ClientEnv [#1213](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/1213) [#1255](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/1255)

  The new member `makeClientRequest` of `ClientEnv` is used to create
  `http-client` `Request` from `servant-client-core` `Request`.
  This functionality can be used for example to set
  dynamic timeouts for each request.

- *servant-server* use queryString to parse QueryParam, QueryParams and QueryFlag [#1249](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/1249) [#1262](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/1262)

  Some APIs need query parameters rewriting, e.g. in order to support
   for multiple casing (camel, snake, etc) or something to that effect.

  This could be easily achieved by using WAI Middleware and modifying
  request's `Query`. But QueryParam, QueryParams and QueryFlag use
  `rawQueryString`. By using `queryString` rather then `rawQueryString`
  we can enable such rewritings.

- *servant* *servant-server* Make packages `build-type: Simple` [#1263](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/1263)

  We used `build-type: Custom`, but it's problematic e.g.
  for cross-compiling. The benefit is small, as the doctests
  can be run other ways too (though not so conveniently).

- *servant* Remove deprecated modules [1268#](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/1268)
  
  - `Servant.Utils.Links` is `Servant.Links`
  - `Servant.API.Internal.Test.ComprehensiveAPI` is `Servant.Test.ComprehensiveAPI`

### Other changes

- *servant-client* *servant-client-core* *servant-http-streams* Fix Verb with headers checking content type differently [#1200](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/issues/1200) [#1204](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/1204)

  For `Verb`s with response `Headers`, the implementation didn't check
  for the content-type of the response. Now it does.

- *servant-docs* Merge documentation from duplicate routes [#1240](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/issues/1240) [#1241](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/1241)

  Servant supports defining the same route multiple times with different
  content-types and result-types, but servant-docs was only documenting
  the first of copy of such duplicated routes. It now combines the
  documentation from all the copies.

  Unfortunately, it is not yet possible for the documentation to specify
  multiple status codes.

- Add sponsorship button [#1190](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/1190)

### Significant changes

- Streaming refactoring.
  [#991](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/991)
  [#1076](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/1076)
  [#1077](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/1077)

  The streaming functionality (`Servant.API.Stream`) is refactored to use
  `servant`'s own `SourceIO` type (see `Servant.Types.SourceT` documentation),
  which replaces both `StreamGenerator` and `ResultStream` types.

  New conversion type-classes are `ToSourceIO` and `FromSourceIO`
  (replacing `ToStreamGenerator` and `BuildFromStream`).
  There are instances for *conduit*, *pipes* and *machines* in new packages:
  [servant-conduit](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/servant-conduit)
  [servant-pipes](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/servant-pipes) and
  [servant-machines](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/servant-machines)
  respectively.

  Writing new framing strategies is simpler. Check existing strategies for examples.

  This change shouldn't affect you, if you don't use streaming endpoints.

- *servant-client* Separate streaming client.
  [#1066](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/1066)

  We now have two `http-client` based clients,
  in `Servant.Client` and `Servant.Client.Streaming`.

  Their API is the same, except for
  - `Servant.Client` **cannot** request `Stream` endpoints.
  - `Servant.Client` is *run* by direct
    `runClientM :: ClientM a -> ClientEnv -> IO (Either ServantError a)`
  - `Servant.Client.Streaming` **can** request `Stream` endpoints.
  - `Servant.Client.Streaming` is *used* by CPSised
    `withClientM :: ClientM a -> ClientEnv -> (Either ServantError a -> IO b) -> IO b`

  To access `Stream` endpoints use `Servant.Client.Streaming` with
  `withClientM`; otherwise you can continue using `Servant.Client` with `runClientM`.
  You can use both too, `ClientEnv` and `BaseUrl` types are same for both.

  **Note:** `Servant.Client.Streaming` doesn't *stream* non-`Stream` endpoints.
  Requesting ordinary `Verb` endpoints (e.g. `Get`) will block until
  the whole response is received.

  There is `Servant.Client.Streaming.runClientM` function, but it has
  restricted type. `NFData a` constraint prevents using it with
  `SourceT`, `Conduit` etc. response types.

  ```haskell
  runClientM :: NFData a => ClientM a -> ClientEnv -> IO (Either ServantError a)
  ```

  This change shouldn't affect you, if you don't use streaming endpoints.

- *servant-client-core* Related to the previous:
  `streamingResponse` is removed from `RunClient`.
  We have a new type-class:

  ```haskell
  class RunClient m =>  RunStreamingClient m where
      withStreamingRequest :: Request -> (StreamingResponse -> IO a) ->  m a
  ```

- Drop support for GHC older than 8.0
  [#1008](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/1008)
  [#1009](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/1009)

- *servant* `ComprehensiveAPI` is a part of public API in `Servant.Test.ComprehensiveAPI` module.
  This API type is used to verify that libraries implement all core combinators.
  Now we won't change this type between major versions.
  (This has been true for some time already).
  [#1070](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/1070)

- *servant* Remove `Servant.Utils.Enter` module
  (deprecated in `servant-0.12` in favour of `hoistServer`)
  [#996](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/996)

- *servant-foreign* Add support so `HasForeign` can be implemented for
  `MultipartForm` from [`servant-multipart`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/servant-multipart)
  [#1035](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/1035)

### Significant changes

- `Stream` takes a status code argument

  ```diff
  -Stream method        framing ctype a
  +Stream method status framing ctype a
  ```

  ([#966](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/966)
   [#972](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/972))

- `ToStreamGenerator` definition changed, so it's possible to write an instance
  for conduits.

  ```diff
  -class ToStreamGenerator f a where
  -   toStreamGenerator :: f a -> StreamGenerator a
  +class ToStreamGenerator a b | a -> b where
  +   toStreamGenerator :: a -> StreamGenerator b
  ```

  ([#959](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/959))

- Added `NoFraming` streaming strategy
  ([#959](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/959))

- *servant-client-core* Free `Client` implementation.
  Useful for testing `HasClient` instances.
  ([#920](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/920))

- *servant-client-core* Add `hoistClient` to `HasClient`.
  Just like `hoistServer` allows us to change the monad in which request handlers
  of a web application live, we also have `hoistClient` for changing the monad
  in which *client functions* live.
  Read [tutorial section for more information](https://docs.servant.dev/en/release-0.14/tutorial/Client.html#changing-the-monad-the-client-functions-live-in).
  ([#936](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/936))

  iF you have own combinators, you'll need to define a new method of
  `HasClient` class, for example:

  ```haskell
  type Client m (MyCombinator :> api) = MyValue :> Client m api
  hoistClientMonad pm _ nt cl = hoistClientMonad pm (Proxy :: Proxy api) nt . cl
  ```

- *servant* Add `safeLink' :: (Link -> a) -> ... -> MkLink endpoint a`,
  which allows to create helpers returning something else than `Link`.
  ([#968](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/968))

- *servant-server* File serving in polymorphic monad.
  i.e. Generalised types of `serveDirectoryFileServer` etc functions in
  `Servant.Utils.StaticFiles`
  ([#953](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/953))

- *servant-server* `ReqBody` content type check is recoverable.
  This allows writing APIs like:

  ```haskell
        ReqBody '[JSON] Int      :> Post '[PlainText] Int
  :<|>  ReqBody '[PlainText] Int :> Post '[PlainText] Int
  ```

  which is useful when handlers are subtly different,
  for example may do less work.
  ([#937](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/937))

- *servant-client* Add more constructors to `RequestBody`, including
  `RequestBodyStream`.
  *Note:* we are looking for http-library agnostic API,
  so the might change again soon.
  Tell us which constructors are useful for you!
  ([#913](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/913))

### Significant changes

- Streaming endpoint support.
  ([#836](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/836))

  ```haskell
  type StreamApi f = "streamGetNewline" :> StreamGet NewlineFraming JSON (f Person)
  ```

  See tutorial for more details
  - [A web API as a type - StreamGet and StreamPost](http://docs.servant.dev/en/release-0.13/tutorial/ApiType.html#streamget-and-streampost)
  - [Serving an API - streaming endpoints](http://docs.servant.dev/en/release-0.13/tutorial/Server.html#streaming-endpoints)
  - [Querying an API - Querying Streaming APIs](http://docs.servant.dev/en/release-0.13/tutorial/Client.html#querying-streaming-apis)

- *servant* Add `Servant.API.Modifiers`
  ([#873](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/873)
   [#903](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/903))

  `QueryParam`, `Header` and `ReqBody` understand modifiers:
  - `Required` or `Optional` (resulting in `a` or `Maybe a` in handlers)
  - `Strict` or `Lenient` (resulting in `a` or `Either String a` in handlers)

  Also you can use `Description` as a modifier, but it doesn't yet work
  with `servant-docs`, only `servant-swagger`. [There is an issue.](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/issues/902)

- *servant-client* Support `http-client`’s `CookieJar`
  ([#897](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/897)
   [#883](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/883))

  `ClientM` preserves cookies between requests,
  if given initial `CookieJar`.
  To migrate from older code, change `ClientEnv` constructor
  to `mkClientEnv` which makes `ClientEnv` without `CookieJar`.

- *servant* Mono-kind-ise modifiers, resulting in better error messages.
  ([#887](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/issues/887)
   [#890](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/890))

- *servant* Add `TypeError ... => HasServer`s instances in GHC-8.2 for
  not saturated modifiers (`Capture "foo" :> ...`) or `->` in place of `:>`.
  ([#893](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/893))

### Bug fixes

- Prevent double-escaping in link segments
  ([#835](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/issues/835)
   [#878](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/878))

### Significant changes

- *servant-client* *servant-client-core*
  Factored out of `servant-client` all the functionality that was
  independent of the `http-client` backend.
  ([#803](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/803)
   [#821](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/issues/821))

  If you have own combinators, you'll need to add an additional `m` argument
  in `HasClient`, `Client` and `clientWithRoute`:

  ```diff
  -class HasClient api
  -  type Client (api :: *) :: *
  -  clientWithRoute :: Proxy api -> Req -> Client api
  +class HasClient m api
  +  type Client (m :: * -> *) (api :: *) :: *
  +  clientWithRoute :: Proxy m -> Proxy api -> Request -> Client m api
  ```

  See https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant-auth/pull/67/commits/f777818e3cc0fa3ed2346baff8328e96d62b1790 for a real world example.

- *servant-server* Added `hoistServer` member to the `HasServer` class, which is `HasServer`
  specific `enter`.
  ([#804](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/804)
   [#824](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/824))

  `enter` isn't exported from `Servant` module anymore. You can change
  `enter` to `hoistServer` in a straight forward way.
  Unwrap natural transformation and add an api type `Proxy`:

  ```diff
  -server = enter (NT nt) impl
  +server = hoistServer (Proxy :: Proxy MyApi) nt impl
  ```

  If you have own combinators, you'll need to define a new method of
  `HasServer` class, for example:

  ```haskell
  type ServerT (MyCombinator :> api) m = MyValue -> ServerT api m
  hoistServerWithContext _ pc nt s = hoistServerWithContext (Proxy :: Proxy api) pc nt . s
  ```

  See https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant-auth/pull/67/commits/8ee3b6315247ac076516213fd7cfcdbfdb583ac9 for a real world example.

- Add `Description` and `Summary` combinators
  ([#767](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/767))

  It's possible to annotate endpoints with free form text.
  This information is used by e.g. by `servant-swagger`, see screenshot in
  https://github.com/phadej/servant-swagger-ui

- Lower `:>` and `:<|>` infix precedence to 4 and 3 respectively
  ([#761](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/issues/761))

  This shouldn't affect you, except if you define your own infix operators
  for Servant type-level DSL.
