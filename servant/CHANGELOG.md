0.14.1
------

- Merge in (and slightly refactor) `servant-generic`
  (by [Patrick Chilton](https://github.com/chpatrick))
  into `servant` (`Servant.API.Generic`),
  `servant-client-code` (`Servant.Client.Generic`)
  and `servant-server` (`Servant.Server.Generic`).

- Deprecate `Servant.Utils.Links`, use `Servant.Links`.

- *servant-server* Deprecate `Servant.Utils.StaticUtils`, use `Servant.Server.StaticUtils`.

### Signifacant changes

- `Stream` takes a status code argument

  ```diff
  -Stream method        framing ctype a
  +Stream method status framing ctype a
  ```

  ([#966](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/966)
   [#972](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/972))

- `ToStreamGenerator` definition changed, so it's possible to write an instance
  for conduits.

  ```diff
  -class ToStreamGenerator f a where
  -   toStreamGenerator :: f a -> StreamGenerator a
  +class ToStreamGenerator a b | a -> b where
  +   toStreamGenerator :: a -> StreamGenerator b
  ```

  ([#959](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/959))

- Added `NoFraming` streaming strategy
  ([#959](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/959))

- *servant-client-core* Free `Client` implementation.
  Useful for testing `HasClient` instances.
  ([#920](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/920))

- *servant-client-core* Add `hoistClient` to `HasClient`.
  Just like `hoistServer` allows us to change the monad in which request handlers
  of a web application live in, we also have `hoistClient` for changing the monad
  in which *client functions* live.
  Read [tutorial section for more information](https://haskell-servant.readthedocs.io/en/release-0.14/tutorial/Client.html#changing-the-monad-the-client-functions-live-in).
  ([#936](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/936))

  iF you have own combinators, you'll need to define a new method of
  `HasClient` class, for example:

  ```haskell
  type Client m (MyCombinator :> api) = MyValue :> Client m api
  hoistClientMonad pm _ nt cl = hoistClientMonad pm (Proxy :: Proxy api) nt . cl
  ```

- *servant* Add `safeLink' :: (Link -> a) -> ... -> MkLink endpoint a`,
  which allows to create helpers returning something else than `Link`.
  ([#968](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/968))

- *servant-server* File serving in polymorphic monad.
  i.e. Generalised types of `serveDirectoryFileServer` etc functions in
  `Servant.Utils.StaticFiles`
  ([#953](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/953))

- *servant-server* `ReqBody` content type check is recoverable.
  This allows writing APIs like:

  ```haskell
        ReqBody '[JSON] Int      :> Post '[PlainText] Int
  :<|>  ReqBody '[PlainText] Int :> Post '[PlainText] Int
  ```

  which is useful when handlers are subtly different,
  for example may do less work.
  ([#937](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/937))

- *servant-client* Add more constructors to `RequestBody`, including
  `RequestBodyStream`.
  *Note:* we are looking for http-library agnostic API,
  so the might change again soon.
  Tell us which constructors are useful for you!
  ([#913](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/913))

### Other changes

- `GetHeaders` instances implemented without `OverlappingInstances`
  ([#971](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/971))

  ([#946](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/946))

- Add [`servant-flatten` "spice" to the structuring api recipe](https://haskell-servant.readthedocs.io/en/release-0.14/cookbook/structuring-apis/StructuringApis.html)

0.13.0.1
--------

- Support `base-compat-0.10`

0.13
----

### Significant changes

- Streaming endpoint support.
  ([#836](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/836))

  ```haskell
  type StreamApi f = "streamGetNewline" :> StreamGet NewlineFraming JSON (f Person)
  ```

  See tutorial for more details

  - [Querying an API - Querying Streaming APIs](http://haskell-servant.readthedocs.io/en/release-0.13/tutorial/Client.html#querying-streaming-apis)

- *servant* Add `Servant.API.Modifiers`
  ([#873](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/873)
   [#903](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/903))

  `QueryParam`, `Header` and `ReqBody` understand modifiers:
  - `Required` or `Optional` (resulting in `a` or `Maybe a` in handlers)
  - `Strict` or `Lenient` (resulting in `a` or `Either String a` in handlers)

  Also you can use `Description` as a modifier, but it doesn't yet work
  with `servant-docs`, only `servant-swagger`. [There is an issue.](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/issues/902)

- *servant-client* Support `http-client`â€™s `CookieJar`
  ([#897](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/897)
   [#883](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/883))

  `ClientM` preserves cookies between requests,
  if given initial `CookieJar`.
  To migrate from older code, change `ClientEnv` constructor
  to `mkClientEnv` which makes `ClientEnv` without `CookieJar`.

- *servant* Mono-kind-ise modifiers, resulting in better error messages.
  ([#887](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/issues/887)
   [#890](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/890))

- *servant* Add `TypeError ... => HasServer`s instances in GHC-8.2 for
  not saturated modifiers (`Capture "foo" :> ...`) or `->` in place of `:>`.
  ([#893](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/893))

### Bug fixes

- Prevent double-escaping in link segments
  ([#835](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/issues/835)
   [#878](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/878))

### Significant changes

- *servant-client* *servant-client-core*
  Factored out of `servant-client` all the functionality that was
  independent of the `http-client` backend.
  ([#803](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/803)
   [#821](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/issues/821))

  If you have own combinators, you'll need to add an additional `m` argument
  in `HasClient`, `Client` and `clientWithRoute`:

  ```diff
  -class HasClient api
  -  type Client (api :: *) :: *
  -  clientWithRoute :: Proxy api -> Req -> Client api
  +class HasClient m api
  +  type Client (m :: * -> *) (api :: *) :: *
  +  clientWithRoute :: Proxy m -> Proxy api -> Request -> Client m api
  ```

  See https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant-auth/pull/67/commits/f777818e3cc0fa3ed2346baff8328e96d62b1790 for a real world example.

- *servant-server* Added `hoistServer` member to the `HasServer` class, which is `HasServer`
  specific `enter`.
  ([#804](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/804)
   [#824](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/824))

  `enter` isn't exported from `Servant` module anymore. You can change
  `enter` to `hoistServer` in a straight forward way.
  Unwrap natural transformation and add a api type `Proxy`:

  ```diff
  -server = enter (NT nt) impl
  +server = hoistServer (Proxy :: Proxy MyApi) nt impl
  ```

  If you have own combinators, you'll need to define a new method of
  `HasServer` class, for example:

  ```haskell
  type ServerT (MyCombinator :> api) m = MyValue -> ServerT api m
  hoistServerWithContext _ pc nt s = hoistServerWithContext (Proxy :: Proxy api) pc nt . s
  ```

  See https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant-auth/pull/67/commits/8ee3b6315247ac076516213fd7cfcdbfdb583ac9 for a real world example.

- Add `Description` and `Summary` combinators
  ([#767](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/767))

  It's possible to annotate endpoints with free form text.
  This information is used by e.g. by `servant-swagger`, see screenshot in
  https://github.com/phadej/servant-swagger-ui

- Lower `:>` and `:<|>` infix precedence to 4 and 3 respectively
  ([#761](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/issues/761))

  This shouldn't affect you, except if you define your own infix operators
  for Servant type-level DSL.
